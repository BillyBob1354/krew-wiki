It is suggested that the player collects crabs, shells, or goes fishing for a while at first to obtain a larger [Ship](/pages/ships.md) than the [Raft 3](/pages/ships/raft3.md).

When first starting out, it is recommended that you collect shells and crabs. This is because one fish earns you about $50 - $350 (varying) while crabs and shells earn you about the same however they spawn more frequently and the crabs varies from $30-$400. One more added advantage is that your [Ships](/pages/ships.md) cannot take damage when not at the sea while you still earn the same amount of money.

However, there is another strategy that is possible if you want to play aggressively. If you simply select the option spawn in the sea on the menu you can sail in a circle and Fishing Rod fish and kill other players who come near. In this scenario, it seems that while Fishing Rod at sea, there is a considerable increase in Fishing Rod speed which is an added advantage.

It is also recommended that you buy a [Boat 1](/pages/ships/boat1.md) if there is a lot of traffic since you will lose little Gold as one of the quests will give you an instantaneous return of 5000. However, if there seems to be a small number of players you could buy a [Trader 1](/pages/ships/trader1.md) and start [Economy](/pages/economy.md) as buying a [Trader 1](/pages/ships/trader1.md) will only give a profit of $650 due to one of the earlier quests as mentioned above. However, it is important to note that you only have the option of choosing the [Trader 1](/pages/ships/trader1.md) or a [Boat 1](/pages/ships/boat1.md)if you want to earn the 5000 from the quest .. hence It is advisable that you choose on the basis of how players are near you.


# Shooting 
When turning your ship and shooting, your shots are a bit higher than usual, so try to aim lower.

# Builds
Changing the build of your character gives a significant edge during combat and is necessary to find one's personal favourite, experiment with different builds and [Items](/pages/items.md) to make the best possible build for your skillset and gain the edge during battle.

# Spyglass and Corner Peak
Spyglass grants extra visibility and makes the fog more see-through, you can use the Spyglass to scout ahead for enemy ships or look for ships to prey upon, experienced players also use a technique called as Corner Peak, as the visibility at the corners of the window is more than the middle. It is recommended to do quick scans of the seas, once every 5 minutes to update yourself about the ships in the area, this is vital in busier trade routes as Baby Fancy ambushes will quickly take you out the equation.

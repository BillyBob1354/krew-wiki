# Islands

In the world of [Krew.io](https://krew.io), there are ten islands. They are places where ships may dock to upgrade themselves and players to purchase items and goods. Note that 8 seconds after a boat arrives at an island, they may dock, making them invulnerable. During these 8 seconds though, they are vulnerable to any attacks, unlike departing, which takes 5 or 25 seconds instead of 8 seconds and is invulnerable during that 5 or 25 seconds.

## Island List

- Spain
- Phillipines
- Guinea
- Labrador

## Island abilities

At each island, you are allowed to:

* Buy [Ships](/pages/ships.md)
* Buy [Items](/pages/items.md)
* Buy/Sell Cargo
* Join / Change krews that are docked there
* Deposit / withdraw from The Bank (only works at Labrador)

Note that upon 8 seconds after arriving at an island, the captain of a vessel will be able to dock the ship, which will make it invincible to any enemies. However, during that 8 second period, the ship will be vulnerable to all enemy vessels, unlike departing, which takes either 5 or 25 seconds instead of 8 seconds and is invulnerable during that wait time.
